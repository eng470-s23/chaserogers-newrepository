## pitch
- My research topic is: 
  * Gender description in literature
- My research question is: 
  * How has the description of male characters written by male authors evolved?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: 
  * I plan to reference a series of studies which have collected data sets which things such as the frequency of adjectives as well as the gender of the characters which the adjective modifies. I will reference both the study and the data sets which informed the studies. To present the data and findings, I will use _TimelineJS_ to create an interactive timeline.
- I plan to *process* these materials by:
  * I will process the materials by reading through the study findings and analyzing the data sets which the teams compiled. Key points from the studied which pertain to my research question will be noted, as will relevant information within the data sets.
- I plan to *present* these materials by:
  * Compiling the data into an interactive timeline to present the data and findings in an organized and visually appealing way.
- My final submission will take this form: 
  * A _GitHub Repository_ which will include the interactive timeline built in _TimelineJS_.
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities:
  * Those interested with the intersection of gender and literature, primarily gender studies scholars.
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: 
  * As an advertising major, I have experience presenting information in an appealing and comprehensive way. Additonally, I have been an avid reader for most of my life, so I have a knowledge of how to analyze novels and literature.
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: 
  * TimelineJS, how to incorporate outside materials into GitHub, and higher level data analysis.

# week 4 
## notes
- focus on latter timeline (1950s-2000)
- curate own data set; use excerpts from books in NYT best sellers list - approx. 500 word passages
- Voyant tools to analyze texts and extract adjectives
- look into sources on toxic masculinity as well

## search log
- Source 6 by recommendation from Dr. Burkert on r/Dataset subreddit
- Sources 2,4, 5, and 7 found using Google Scholar
   * Search terms used: "gender" "fiction" "literature" 
- Source 3 found on UO Library search
   * Search terms used: "gender" "fiction" "literature" "masculinity"
- All sources found on first search on respective databases

## bibliography
*The bibliography should include at least seven (7) sources:*
- *at least one primary (literary or archival) source or dataset you are studying or examining;* 
- *at least four peer-reviewed scholarly sources framing and informing your thinking: articles, chapters, or books published by university or academic presses, or excerpts from academic reference sources (note that being deposited in Scholars' Bank does *not* mean a source is peer reviewed.)*
- *the other 2+ sources may be primary, scholarly, popular, journalistic, governmental/policy documents, datasets, etc.*

1. **source #1:** 
    * My primary source will be a dataset which I have compiled and collected from fiction novels between 1950-2020. The data set will be made by running digital transcripts through Voyant tools to analyze the texts and extract the adjectives for data.
      * This data set will be my primary reference point for the project. It will include 5 fiction novels pulled from the NYT bestsellers list, with the chosen books ranging from 1950-2020.
2. **source #2:** 
    * Underwood, T., Bamman, D., &amp; Lee, S. (2018). The transformation of gender in English-language fiction. Journal of Cultural Analytics, 3(2). https://doi.org/10.22148/16.019 
      * This article analyzes the importance and significance of gender in fictional literature from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 21st. While the article looks at all gender distinctions, not just masculinity, it gives strong inside into the ways which gender distinctions in fiction writing have changed through modern literature. I plan to use this source as a reference point for my own findings, comparing trends which I see in my own data set, to the ones laid out within this article.
3. **source #3:**
    * Kraicer, E., &amp; Piper, A. (2019). Social characters: The hierarchy of gender in contemporary English-language fiction. Journal of Cultural Analytics, 3(2). https://doi.org/10.22148/16.032 
      * This articles examines the underrepresentation of women, but also covers what they find to be an emphasis on heteronormativity, both in female and male characters. The article explains that while heteronormativity often refers to romantic relationships, it also refers to and informs the roles and behaviors of main characters within literature. I will use the findings of this article to inform my research in my own corpus.
4. **source #4:**
    * Kneeskern, E. E., & Reeder, P. A. (2022). Examining the impact of fiction literature on children's gender stereotypes. Current Psychology, 41(3), 1472+. https://link-gale-com.libproxy.uoregon.edu/apps/doc/A697815663/AONE?u=euge94201&sid=bookmark-AONE&xid=5c1c027a
      * This article reports the findings of two experiments which tested the impact of fiction literature on children's perceptions of gender roles. I'll use the=is article and the corresponding experiments to give context to the research I do, framing the findings and purpose of the project through an lense which analyzes the influence that writing characters can have on developing minds.
5. **source #5:**
    * Yaşayan, V. (2021). Manifestations of Toxic Masculinity in Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West. American Studies in Scandinavia, 53(2), 69–99. https://doi.org/10.22439/asca.v53i2.6392
      * This article examines the writing of Cormac McCarthy in his book *Blood Meridian* and explains how his use of toxic masculinity tropes for his male charachters is used as a critique of the hegemonic view on masculinity, as well as a sort of prediction for the direction awareness towards how masculinity is perceived would take. I hope to use this as a reference for how writing toxic masculinity can be used as a means to critique it.
6. **source #6:**
    * Williams, A. (2022, July 3). NY_TIMES_FICTION_BEST_SELLERS_1931-2022-wikipedia. Kaggle. Retrieved April 28, 2023, from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaddrick/ny-times-fiction-best-sellers-19312022wikipedia 
      * This is the data set which I will pull my NYT bestsellers from to build my corpus. 
7. **source #7:**
    * Sen, E., &amp; Karagul, S. (2021). A study of secondary school students’ perceptions of fictional characters. International Journal of Educational Methodology, 7(3), 433–446. https://doi.org/10.12973/ijem.7.3.433 
      * Much like the Kneeskern and Reeder article, this reports findings of the impact which fictional characters can have in the development of a child's personality, gender perception, and identity.
