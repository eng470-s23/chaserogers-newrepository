# Project Log

# week 3

## pitch
- My research topic is: 
  * Gender description in literature
- My research question is: 
  * How has the description of male characters written by male authors evolved?
- I expect to work with the following *materials*: 
  * I plan to reference a series of studies which have collected data sets which things such as the frequency of adjectives as well as the gender of the characters which the adjective modifies. I will reference both the study and the data sets which informed the studies. To present the data and findings, I will use _TimelineJS_ to create an interactive timeline.
- I plan to *process* these materials by:
  * I will process the materials by reading through the study findings and analyzing the data sets which the teams compiled. Key points from the studied which pertain to my research question will be noted, as will relevant information within the data sets.
- I plan to *present* these materials by:
  * Compiling the data into an interactive timeline to present the data and findings in an organized and visually appealing way.
- My final submission will take this form: 
  * A _GitHub Repository_ which will include the interactive timeline built in _TimelineJS_.
- This project is intended to engage these audiences and communities:
  * Those interested with the intersection of gender and literature, primarily gender studies scholars.
- I bring the following existing knowledge and/or skills to the project: 
  * As an advertising major, I have experience presenting information in an appealing and comprehensive way. Additonally, I have been an avid reader for most of my life, so I have a knowledge of how to analyze novels and literature.
- In order to do this project, I need to learn: 
  * TimelineJS, how to incorporate outside materials into GitHub, and higher level data analysis.

## bibliography

1. **source #1:** 
    * My primary source will be a dataset which I have compiled and collected from fiction novels between 1950-2020. The data set will be made by running digital transcripts through Voyant tools to analyze the texts and extract the adjectives for data.
      * This data set will be my primary reference point for the project. It will include 5 fiction novels pulled from the NYT bestsellers list, with the chosen books ranging from 1950-2020.

      * This article analyzes the importance and significance of gender in fictional literature from the end of the 18th century to the beginning of the 21st. While the article looks at all gender distinctions, not just masculinity, it gives strong inside into the ways which gender distinctions in fiction writing have changed through modern literature. I plan to use this source as a reference point for my own findings, comparing trends which I see in my own data set, to the ones laid out within this article.

      * This articles examines the underrepresentation of women, but also covers what they find to be an emphasis on heteronormativity, both in female and male characters. The article explains that while heteronormativity often refers to romantic relationships, it also refers to and informs the roles and behaviors of main characters within literature. I will use the findings of this article to inform my research in my own corpus.

      * This article reports the findings of two experiments which tested the impact of fiction literature on children's perceptions of gender roles. I'll use the=is article and the corresponding experiments to give context to the research I do, framing the findings and purpose of the project through an lense which analyzes the influence that writing characters can have on developing minds.

      * This article examines the writing of Cormac McCarthy in his book *Blood Meridian* and explains how his use of toxic masculinity tropes for his male charachters is used as a critique of the hegemonic view on masculinity, as well as a sort of prediction for the direction awareness towards how masculinity is perceived would take. I hope to use this as a reference for how writing toxic masculinity can be used as a means to critique it.

# week 5

## research question
How did the description of male characters written by male authors evolved from 1950-2000? 

## annotated bibliography

### source 1 annotation
- citation: Underwood, T., Bamman, D., & Lee, S. (2018). The transformation of gender in English-language fiction. Journal of Cultural Analytics, 3(2). [The transformation of gender in English-language fiction](https://doi.org/10.22148/16.019)


- summary: In this article, Underwood, Bamman, and Lee present findings from data analysis on how the significance of gender as a key charasteristic within characters in fiction novels has changed and evolved from the end of the eighteenth century to the early 2000s. The project is built off of a data analysis of literary works which have been collected from the HaithiTrust Digital Library, as well as a collection built by the Chicago Text Lab. The authors used BookNLP to extract the data needed for the project: adjectives, character identification, and the assignment of adjectives and descriptors to specific characters. The authors explain that BookNLP extracted names of characters and clusters them with different forms of that name (the example given is that "Elizabeth" is combined with "Elizabeth Bennett") and then assigns a gender to the characters with 91.3% - 94.7% accuracy. Descriptors for the characters are then pulled and associated with a character name, and then used for analysis. 

- potential use for project: This article and project as a whole can be used as a way to inform my methodology for collecting the data I need to create my data set. Much of the article goes into the methods and tools used to extract the data for the project. The data which the authors collected is almost exactly the type of data which I will need to collect: genders of characters and the descriptors used for specific characters. While my analysis of the data and purpose of my project will be quite different, the methodology behind the data collection and tools used can inform my procedure for creating my own data set.

- summary: This data set, manually collected by author Aaddrick Williams, presents a comprihensive list of the the New York Times best sellers for fiction novels from 1931-2022. The set includes every fiction novel for each year within the time frame which has been noted as a "best seller," as well as the book title, author's name, and the number of months and days whcih the novel spent as a "best seller." Willias explains that the data was collected from various sources, using Wikipedia as a directory to the sources used.

- potential use for project: This data set will be used as my primary reference to pull the novels which I will use to build my corpus. As I plan to only inlcude NYT best sellers by male authors, and within the specific time frame of 1950-2000, I will manually go through the list to make my selection of five novels. As the set also includes the number of months and days spent as a best seller, I will pick one novel by a male author with the longest amount of time spent on the best seller list.

- summary: In this article, Kraicer and Piper examine the underrepresentation of women within fiction, but also cover what they find to be an emphasis on heteronormativity, both in female and male characters. The article explains that while heteronormativity often refers to romantic relationships, it also refers to and informs the roles and behaviors of main characters within literature, stating "we use it here to indicate the extent to which mixed-gender pairs, whether sexual or platonic, significantly dominate the contemporary novel’s social structure." Additionally, Kraicer and Piper find that between female and male authors, female authors write with less heteronormative descriptions and pairings.

- potential use for project: While this article primarily focuses on a comparison between female and male authors and characters, it goes into detail about the prevelance of heteronormative writing and how male authors do so at a higher rate. This is along the lines of something which I predict I will find in my own research, and will use Kraicer and Piper's findings, regarding male characters and authors, to inform my research and project.

# week 6

## annotated bibliography, continued

### source 4 annotation
- citation: My own corpus
- summary: My primary source will be a dataset which I have compiled and collected from fiction novels between 1950-2020. The data set will be made by running digital transcripts through Voyant tools to analyze the texts and extract the necessary data. It will consist of 5 books, 1 for each decade from 1950-2000, written by male authors and selected at random by feeding the available options into a random selection tool. If the tool chooses a book written by a non-male author, the choices will be ran again until the first male author is selected. The book choices will be pulled using the Williams dataset of the NYT fiction best sellers. If a chosen book does not have a .txt file available online, I will purchase a digital verson of the book, and then convert the text into a .txt file using the Zamzar file converter.
- potential use for project: This data set will be the primary source of my project. The texts will then be fed through Voyant for analysis. The analysis will focus the descriptions of the primary male character in each novel. Initially, I planned to use BookNLP to analyze the description of all male charachters in each novel, however, as I have explored BookNLP further, I have found that the level of coding knowledge needed to accomplish this task is too far above my coding and Python capabilities. If I had more time, I would learn how to properly use BookNLP for this task. However, given the timeline of this project, I will be using Voyant, specifically the Cirrus, Terms, and Links tools.

### source 5 annotation

- summary: In this article, Kneeskern and Reeder present two experiments which analyze the ways in which gender stereotypes influence children's support of traditonal gender roles. They explain that traditional stereotypical male characters are far over represented within literature, and that this overrepresentation sways and informs the child's view of gender roles. The article goes on to explain that the experiments found that exposure to counter-traditonal male characters lowered the children's endorsement of traditional stereotypes. exemplifying the impact which the presentation of characters in literature has on children's own perspectives of gender.
- potential use for project: This article helped to solidify this importance of analyzing the ways that character desprictions pertaining to gender, as it has a real effect on how gender roles are perceived. This is nothing new, as it is well known that how gender is presented in media is crucial to moving past traditional gender roles. However, the study frames this within in the context of literature, and specifically the way that gender is addressed and presented in fiction. The article has been more of an informer of mindset and context, rather than methodology or information.

- summary: This article analyzes the ways in which toxic masculinity is portrayed in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian and its main character. Yaşayan poses that McCarthy's use of traditonal masculine stereotypes within the main character is an exploration of the ways that the pursuit to fill those ideals actually brings destruction to one's self and character, and says that McCarthy's self-aware implementation of this was ahead of its time in addressing the problem. He goes on to say that McCarthy uses the "toxic cowboy" archetype as a way to critique toxic masculinity and explore "alternative" forms of masculinity.
- potential use for project: This article framed ways in which toxic masculinity descriptors can actually be used as a critique of the stereotypes themselves. It made me aware that simply doing distant readings and analysis of the adjectives used to describe male characters may not necessarily be enough to analyze the true evolution of how masculinity has been portrayed in fiction.

- summary: This article addresses many of the same topics and point as the Kneeskern and Reeder article, but does so through the lense of education. In other words, it takes the same points as Kneeskern and Reeder, and then examines how those problems and perceptions should be addressed in education directly.
- potential use for project: This article primarly served as supplemenation and further reading to the Kneesern and Reeder article, and added some context to the takeways I gained from that article.

## environmental scan

### contribution

- My project deals specificially with how male characters are presented and described in fictional literature by male authors. The aim of the project is to see if the work which has been made to dismantle hegemonic toxic masculinity, especially within platonic male-to-male relationships, has been reflected and represented within fictional writing. Toxic masculinity is heavily reinforced by other men, and relies heavily on how other men perceive one another. A large contributor to this is how men are represented in media, as many famous male characters have and continue to exude tradional qualities which have historically been identified as those associated with the "ideal man," which we obviously know to be a dangerous, oppressive, and toxic archetype. The layer of focusing on how male authors, specifically, write and dscribe male characters is meant to focus the project on the male-to-male aspect and representation of the work which needs to be, and hopefully has been, done. The goal of the project is to see whether or not there is a pitfall in the representation of the progress towards more healthy views of and relationships with other men, from men.

### methods

- Voyant: Voyant will be used as the first step in the process to analyze the text of my corpus. This will give me a broad overview of what is included in my chosen novels, such as the most frequent words, word pairings, and trends. Voyant is ideal for this task, as it is easy to use, open-source, and allows for broad analysis of text, as well as supplying useful visuals and graphics, which could potentially be used to communicate findings.
- BookNLP: BookNLP will be where the deep analysis starts. This tool groups character names together, allowing for different versions of a name for a character to be associated with the same characters, as well as assigning gender and descriptors to characters as well. BookNLP does the majority of the work which needs to be done for this projects, as its tools are engineered for analysis like mine.
- Squarespace: Squarespace will be where the webpage which presents my findings will be built and housed. Squarespace is ideal, as I will be communicating to a non-academic audience, and the sites which can be built in Squarespace are accessible and allow for streamlined UX. 

### stakeholders / audiences

- My primary audience are fiction lovers, mainly those who are also interested in gender studies. Additionally, a secondary audience would be male authors whose works focus on fiction. Because both of these groups are outside of academia, publishing the project in an easy to navigate and visually interesting way would be the best approach.

### dependencies and resources

- I will need an external hard drive to save my text files, as well as access to a cloud storage service, such as Google drive.
- I will need a squarespace site to house and present my findings.
- I will also need access to ebook marketplaces, which are readily availabel online.
