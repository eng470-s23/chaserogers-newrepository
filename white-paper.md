# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Summary/Abstract (1 paragraph) 

Fictional characters have a strong influence on our development of identity and how we perceive people. Masculinity has historically been represented in a way that aligns with toxic stereotypes, and have reinforced the position of the patriarchy across different mediums, causing consumers to continually be exposed to these stereotypical representations. The coming-of-age genre in fiction literature

## Project Origins and Goals

This project was born out of the realization that research into the way that fiction literature presents and describes masculinity is greatly lacking. Given the impacts which historical ideals of masculinity and patriarchal norms have had – and continue to have – on society, it is important to analyze and identify what mediums these toxic characteristics have been reinforced through. Media outlets such as music and film have received extensive attention in research, but fiction literature has been neglected more than many would think.

The coming-of-age genre presents a unique focus which follows the growth and development of characters through formative years in creating their own identity. This traits givees the genre, and the characters which inhabit it, a unique influence on its readers. The way that authors present masculinity shape readers views on what "masculinity" means. This project aims to examine the representations of masculinity among 4 popular novels within the genre and key characters within them.

Through text analysis, the project sought to gain insight into the state of gender representation in the coming-of-age genre and to answer questions such as: are these novels reinforcing toxically masculine traits? Have we made the progress in representating all forms that masculinity can take in fiction literature? What traits and characteristics are most often attributed to male characters?

In the continuing fight to dismantle and address patriarchal norms, analysis of influential novels and characters can supply us with well needed awareness of the problem within a popular medium amongst individuals searching for guidance on developing their own identity.
