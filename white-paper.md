# What's a White Paper?

In digital humanities, it is common for project teams to publish a report of funded development activities after a grant cycle is completed. The following template is taken from the [instructions provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/how-write-successful-white-paper-tips-odh) to recipients of Digital Humanities Advancement Grants.

## Project Summary/Abstract 

Fictional characters have a strong influence on our development of identity and how we perceive people. Masculinity has historically been represented in a way that aligns with toxic stereotypes, and have reinforced the position of the patriarchy across different mediums, causing consumers to continually be exposed to these stereotypical representations. The coming-of-age genre within fiction literature lacks sufficient research into the presentations of male identities and forms of masculinity. This project examines 4 popular coming-of-age novels to analyze and find commonalities in key males characters and their characteristics. Passages where a primary male protaganist was introduced for the first time were transcribed to be analyzed Additionally, all 4 novels are ones written by a male author, to add a tertiary analysis of how male authors themselves belief how masculinity should be presented. Through text analysis using Voyant, I found that across the 4 novels, the authors tended to attribute traditional ideals of masculinity to the characters, such as strength and high social standings.

**As only 4 novels were analyzed, this project acts a kind of case study into specific novels within the genre, versus and analysis of the genre as a whole.**

## Project Origins and Goals

This project was born out of the realization that research into the way that fiction literature presents and describes masculinity is greatly lacking. Given the impacts which historical ideals of masculinity and patriarchal norms have had – and continue to have – on society, it is important to analyze and identify what mediums these toxic characteristics have been reinforced through. Media outlets such as music and film have received extensive attention in research, but fiction literature has been neglected more than many would think.

The coming-of-age genre presents a unique focus which follows the growth and development of characters through formative years in creating their own identity. This traits givees the genre, and the characters which inhabit it, a unique influence on its readers. The way that authors present masculinity shape readers views on what "masculinity" means. This project aims to examine the representations of masculinity among 4 popular novels within the genre and key characters within them.

Through text analysis, the project sought to gain insight into the state of gender representation in the coming-of-age genre and to answer questions such as: are these novels reinforcing toxically masculine traits? Have we made the progress in representating all forms that masculinity can take in fiction literature? What traits and characteristics are most often attributed to male characters?

In the continuing fight to dismantle and address patriarchal norms, analysis of influential novels and characters can supply us with well needed awareness of the problem within a popular medium amongst individuals searching for guidance on developing their own identity.

## Project Activities

1. The project went through many phases, but the true work began with the selection of 4 novels. The 4 were chosen by many factors, but the key ones were a level of popularity within the genre and within young adult readers, primarily Gen-Z. Additionally, all 4 were selected due to my personal connection to them, as each played a role at one point or another in shaping my own identity and had a hand in forming an awareness of such a complex construction as identity.
2. What followed was a search through each novel for a passage which was dedicated to introducing a key male character. After identifying the appropiate passage, each was transcribed by hand as a plain text file to be used for analysis. Each passage was kept under a word count of 300 to accomadate fair use, as 3 of the novels are still under copyright.
3. Transcriptions were then ran through Voyant for analysis, with the Cirrus and Context tools being the primary focus. The aim was search for trends and commonalities amongst the 4 and even within each text individually.
4. The final step is the construction of a website to house the findings, as well a short write up for the analysis and findings of each novel and corpus as a whole. The target audience for the site, and project, are an audience of fiction literature lovers who are also interested in social issues such as inclusivity and gender studies.
