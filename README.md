## Credits and Acknowledgments

I would like to extend thanks to the many people, scholars, and resources which assisted in the creation and development of this project, without whom this project would not exist. Firstly, Professor Mattie Burkertt, whose guidance and knowledge made the formation of this project possible. The many scholars within gender studies whose groundbreaking work at the intersection of feminism, literature, and media pushed society forward and laid the groundwork for this area of study. The University of Oregon library and their study guides, which supplied me with the necessary knowledge to formulate my ideas and properly organize the many pieces of the research. The authors of the novels which were used for study here for providing such rich and intriguing texts that sparked the idea for analysis. Finally, the creators and people at Voyant and Github who provide and maintain a space for the data and work to be housed and presented.

This project deals with circumstances and conversations surrounding toxic masculinity and patriarchal norms and I would like to acknowledge that this may contain terms or concepts which can be harmful to some. The presentation of traits found in characters in the study which align with the toxic, traditional archetype of masculinity do not serve as an endorsement thereof, but rather as points to critically analyze masculinity within coming-of-age fiction novels and to motivate the further deconstruction of hegemonic masculine perceptions within media.

Furthermore, the contents of this project function within socially constructed notions of gender and gender roles. I would like to acknowledge that as a white male from the United States, my understanding of masculinity is limited to the perceptions which have been constructed under a Westernized version of the concept, which is a narrow mindset that does not represent the diverse range of beliefs and views of marginalized communities. I encourage us to join each other in the journey to understand and educate ourselves on the many ways of viewing the concept of masculinity.

As a student at the University of Oregon, I acknowledge that I inhabit and benefit from the land of the Kalapuya people, who were forcefully removed by colonizers throughout the mid-nineteenth century. The act of inhabiting this land and interacting with the scholarly work done through the college is an opportunity for us to think about the suppression and erasure of Indigenous knowledge, which acts as an arm of continued discrimination towards Indigenous and Kalapuyan people.
