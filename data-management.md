# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats
*Data may originate from observations, experiments, or references; it may be derived from other sources, transformed, or the result of a simulation. Describe your data file formats. Whenever possible, [use non-proprietary formats](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/fileformats) or convert your data to open, shareable formats when archiving data. Remember: data also includes your code and workflow documentation!*

- The primary files types I will be working with are **.txt** and **.jpg/.jpeg**. The .txt files will be used for 3 different types of my data: the transcriptions of passages from the books I will be using as sources, the write-ups of my findings following each analysis of data for each book, as well as for the coding of my repositories. The .jpg/.jpeg files will be the screenshots of the Voyant dashboard and graphs which will serve as the visualizations of my findings. 

# documentation and metadata
*Describe how you will [document your data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/readme) as you gather it. Descriptions of your data (or metadata) can help you and others locate, understand, and interpret your data. Describe the applicable standards for metadata content and format that you will follow, including the procedures and tools/software you will use to capture and edit the metadata.*

- Sources will be documented on Zotero, and each data file will have its own readme file, per the "best practices" on the UO research guide. The readme will contain the data file, as well as a brief description of the purpose and use of the file, and a brief description of the methodology used to collect it.

# organization and storage
*Describe your [file naming convention and version control practices](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/filenaming). Describe [storage methods and backup procedures](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/backup) for the data, including physical and cyber resources and facilities (hard-disk space, backup server, repository). Describe how you will take into consideration privacy, security, intellectual property, and other rights.*

**File Naming**
- For .txt files of book passage transcriptions: transcription_BookName_pagenumber.txt
  - Example: transcription_CallMeByYourName_pg142.txt
- For .txt files of repository: repositoryname_filename_datesaved(YYYYMMDD).txt
  - Example: ChaseRogers-Repository_data-management_20230521.txt
- For .txt files of analysis write-ups: analysis_BookName_version.txt
  - Example: analysis_CallMeByYourName_01.txt
- For .jpg/.jpeg files of Voyant screenshots: VoyantFindings_BookName_version.jpg
  - Example: VoyantFindings_CallMeByYourName_01.jpg

**Storage**
- 3 copies of every file will be saved in 3 different locations: the hard drive on my computer, my personal Google Drive, and an external LaCie hard drive.
  - My personal Google Drive will be used for cloud storage versus the UO OneDrive so that I wll retain access to the files following graduation.
  - External hard drive will be kept seperate from my computer at all times, except for the back-up and transferring of files.

# sharing, publication, and archiving
*Describe what you will do to [provide others access to the data](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management/archiving). Identify any restrictions on who may access the data and under what conditions and a timeline for providing access. Also describe your plans for preserving data, outlining any changes in access anticipated during the preservation timeline, and documenting the resources and capabilities (e.g., equipment, connections, systems, expertise) needed to meet the preservation goals.*

- My data will be deposited into the Scholar's Bank: Data repository supported by the UO. I will reach out to the library to set this up.

# accessibility
*Describe your plans for ensuring that your data and project outputs are accessible for users with disabilities. Basic accessibility features include the use of alternative text for images; captions and transcripts for videos; large, easy-to-read fonts; high-contrast color schemes; text content broken up logically with section headers and lists; and links embedded [in context](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context.html) rather than on phrases like [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Be specific about how you will implement accessibility features that are relevant to your data.*

- All colors and color-palettes used on my project website will be high-contrast to allow for easy reading. All fonts will be sans-serif to allow for less distracting reading. Any image will include descriptive alt-text. Photos of the Voyant dashboard used to present findings will be large, and in addition to alt-text, a brief summary describing what is happening in the dashboard and tools (i.e. trend graphs).
