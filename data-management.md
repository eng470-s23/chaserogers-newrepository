# Data Management Plan

# about this file
Based on the [UO library research guide on data management](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/data-management) and UO's [Basic Accessibility Testing guidance](https://digitalaccessibility.uoregon.edu/assessment/basictesting).

# expected data and formats

- The primary files types I will be working with are **.txt** and **.jpg/.jpeg**. The .txt files will be used for 3 different types of my data: the transcriptions of passages from the books I will be using as sources, the write-ups of my findings following each analysis of data for each book, as well as for the coding of my repositories. The .jpg/.jpeg files will be the screenshots of the Voyant dashboard and graphs which will serve as the visualizations of my findings. 

# documentation and metadata

- Sources will be documented on Zotero, and each data file will have its own readme file, per the "best practices" on the UO research guide. The readme will contain the data file, as well as a brief description of the purpose and use of the file, and a brief description of the methodology used to collect it.

# organization and storage

**File Naming**
- For .txt files of book passage transcriptions: transcription_BookName_pagenumber.txt
  - Example: transcription_CallMeByYourName_pg142.txt
- For .txt files of repository: repositoryname_filename_datesaved(YYYYMMDD).txt
  - Example: ChaseRogers-Repository_data-management_20230521.txt
- For .txt files of analysis write-ups: analysis_BookName_version.txt
  - Example: analysis_CallMeByYourName_01.txt
- For .jpg/.jpeg files of Voyant screenshots: VoyantFindings_BookName_version.jpg
  - Example: VoyantFindings_CallMeByYourName_01.jpg

**Storage**
- 3 copies of every file will be saved in 3 different locations: the hard drive on my computer, my personal Google Drive, and an external LaCie hard drive.
  - My personal Google Drive will be used for cloud storage versus the UO OneDrive so that I wll retain access to the files following graduation.
  - External hard drive will be kept seperate from my computer at all times, except for the back-up and transferring of files.

# sharing, publication, and archiving

- My data will be deposited into the Scholar's Bank: Data repository supported by the UO. I will reach out to the library to set this up.

# accessibility

- All colors and color-palettes used on my project website will be high-contrast to allow for easy reading. All fonts will be sans-serif to allow for less distracting reading. Any image will include descriptive alt-text. Photos of the Voyant dashboard used to present findings will be large, and in addition to alt-text, a brief summary describing what is happening in the dashboard and tools (i.e. trend graphs).
