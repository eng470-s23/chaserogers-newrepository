## Hello book worms!

Welcome to *Exploring Masculinity: Representations of Male Character in Coming-of-Age Novels,* a project which aims to analyze the representations of masculinity in the coming-of-age fiction genre.

This project was born out of the realization that research into the way that fiction literature presents and describes masculinity is greatly lacking. Given the impacts which historical ideals of masculinity and patriarchal norms have had – and continue to have – on society, it is important to analyze and identify what mediums these toxic characteristics have been reinforced through. Media outlets such as music and film have received extensive attention in research, but fiction literature has been neglected more than many would think.

The project is a case-study which examines the ways which male characters are described and the characeristics attributed to them in 4 popular novels of the genre: *Call Me by Your Name* by Andre Acimen, *Norwegian Wood* by Haruki Murakami, *The Sound of Waves* by Yukio Mishima, and *The Sun also Rises* by Ernest Hemingway.

Happy reading!
