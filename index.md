Hello book worms!

Welcome to *Exploring Masculinity: Representations of Male Character in Coming-of-Age Novels,* a project which aims to analyze the representations of masculinity in the coming-of-age fiction genre.

The project is a case-study which examines the ways which male characters are described and the characeristics attributed to them in 4 popular novels of the genre: *Call Me by Your Name* by Andre Acimen, *Norwegian Wood* by Haruki Murakami, *The Sound of Waves* by Yukio Mishima, and *The Sun also Rises* by Ernest Hemingway.

An analysis for each novel, as well as the collection as a whole, can be found on the [analysis](analysis.md) page. Furter information about the project can be found at the links below. Happy reading!
