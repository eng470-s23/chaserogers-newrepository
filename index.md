## Hello book worms!

Welcome to *Exploring Masculinity: Representations of Male Character in Coming-of-Age Novels,* a project which aims to analyze the representations of masculinity in the coming-of-age fiction genre.

Fictional characters have a strong influence on our development of identity and how we perceive people. Masculinity has historically been represented in a way that aligns with toxic stereotypes, and have reinforced the position of the patriarchy across different mediums, causing consumers to continually be exposed to these stereotypical representations. The coming-of-age genre within fiction literature lacks sufficient research into the presentations of male identities and forms of masculinity. This project examines 4 popular coming-of-age novels to analyze and find commonalities in key males characters and their characteristics. Passages where a primary male protaganist was introduced for the first time were transcribed to be analyzed. Additionally, all 4 novels are ones written by a male author, to add a tertiary analysis of how male authors themselves belief how masculinity should be presented.

The project is a case-study which examines the ways which male characters are described and the characeristics attributed to them in 4 popular novels of the genre: *Call Me by Your Name* by Andre Acimen, *Norwegian Wood* by Haruki Murakami, *The Sound of Waves* by Yukio Mishima, and *The Sun Also Rises* by Ernest Hemingway.

Happy reading!
