# Analysis and Findings

The analysis from the project is broken down into 5 sections: 1 section for the analysis of the whole corpus, examing commonalites and trends amongst all 4 novels within a digital text analysis tool called Voyant, and then 1 section dedicated to each novel. 

**More will be added here before final portfolio and project submission. This is simply the placeholder.**
