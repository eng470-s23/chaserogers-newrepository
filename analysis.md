# Analysis and Findings

The analysis from the project is broken down into 5 sections: 1 section for the analysis of the whole corpus, examing commonalites and trends amongst all 4 novels within a digital text analysis tool called Voyant, and then 1 section dedicated to each novel. 

**More will be added here before final portfolio and project submission, as this is the primary focus of the site and project. This is simply the placeholder.**

## Corpus Analysis

Analysis of the corpus (all 4 novels together) is the true meat of the project. Because of small passage sizes, individual examinations of each novels, while still worthwhile, did not produce the sort of insights which this project focuses on. On the other hand, when all 4 novels are analyzed together, we begin to see a series of commonalities. The primary one being that yes, these 4 books and their passages introducing significant male characters do seem to describe the character as fitting in with traditional, masculine ideals. While this was not a surprise, the way in which these 4 novels did so was.
