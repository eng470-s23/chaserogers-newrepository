# Analysis and Findings

The analysis from the project is broken down into 5 sections: 1 section for the analysis of the whole corpus, examing commonalites and trends amongst all 4 novels within a digital text analysis tool called Voyant, and then 1 section dedicated to each novel. 

**More will be added here before final portfolio and project submission, as this is the primary focus of the site and project. This is simply the placeholder.**

# Corpus Analysis

Analysis of the corpus (all 4 novels together) is the true meat of the project. Because of small passage sizes, individual examinations of each novels, while still worthwhile, did not produce the sort of insights which this project focuses on. On the other hand, when all 4 novels are analyzed together, we begin to see a series of commonalities. The primary one being that yes, these 4 books and their passages introducing significant male characters do seem to describe the character as fitting in with traditional, masculine ideals. While this was not a surprise, the way in which these 4 novels did so was.

### Expertise and Command

When analyzing the descriptors of the 4 characters, we notice something quite interesting. Each novel has a tendency to assign a degree of expertise and command in different areas to each of the characters. Common descriptors for the caracters were words such as "exceptionally," "talented," "interesting," and "exceedingly."

In the case of **Robert Cohn** in *The Sun also Rises,* his prowess and success as a boxing champion is highlighted in his introduction, and area which he was the top of his class in. In **Oliver's** case in *Call Me by Your Name,* his ability to read and charm people is his area of prowess. 
But no matter what area each character was described as being exceedingly well in, one aspect was described as an area of excellence in all the characters: **the ability to command attention and lead social interactions.** This is most evident in **Kizuki's** case in *Norwegian Wood,* where he is described as having the qualities of a "TV host."

### Traditional Ideals of Masculinity

The commonalities don't stop at the idea of expertise. In addition, we see each novel describe the analyzed character in a way that fits the ideals of a traditional and toxic view of masculinity. 

When describing their physical appearance, they are often given characteristics such as being tall, built physically strong, and having stoic physical expressions. But we seem heteronormative and traditional traits within the descriptions of their mental and emotional character as well. Looking at the word cloud in the Cirrus tool, we see identifiers such as being emotionally cold, analytical, and emotionally reserved. These all fit the idea than men, or masculinity, should be defined by a degree of detachement from emotions, and approaching situations and life with a more "logical" perspective. 

We see this present in terms such as "**hardened**," "**unapproachable**," "**sagacious**," and "**unfazed**."

The terms present within the word cloud show the reinforcement of these traits across the entire corpus.
